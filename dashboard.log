Answer: Unfortunately, I was unable to find any specific companies that are targeting TROP2. However, it's possible that some companies may be working on TROP2-related projects, but they may not have publicly disclosed this information. If you could provide more context or clarify what you're looking for, I may be able to help further.

Answer: Some notable companies that have developed or are developing treatments for HER2-positive breast cancer include Genentech (a member of the Roche Group), Pfizer, and Eli Lilly. However, it's worth noting that this list may not be exhaustive, as there may be other companies working on HER2-related projects that are not publicly disclosed.
