## ðŸ“‹ Final Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] **Test Docker build locally** (if Docker credentials are working)
- [ ] **Verify ground truth file exists** (`data/Pipeline_Ground_Truth.xlsx`)
- [ ] **Check environment variables** (API keys, database settings)
- [ ] **Test data collection pipeline** (run `python run_pipeline.py data-collect`)
- [ ] **Test validation system** (run `python scripts/validation/run_validation.py`)

### Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Build and run
make docker-compose-up

# Or manually
docker-compose up --build

# Access at: http://localhost:8501
```

#### Option 2: Streamlit Cloud
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Deploy at [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
3. Set main file: `scripts/main/streamlit_app.py`
4. Add secrets: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `MODEL_PROVIDER`, etc.

#### Option 3: Local with ngrok
```bash
# Start app
python run_pipeline.py web

# In another terminal
ngrok http 8501
```

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] **Dashboard loads** - All pages accessible
- [ ] **RAG Agent works** - Can ask questions and get responses
- [ ] **Data collection works** - Can run pipeline and collect data
- [ ] **Validation works** - Ground truth validation displays results
- [ ] **Business Intelligence works** - Market analysis and business analysis dashboards
- [ ] **Export works** - CSV downloads function properly
- [ ] **Docker health checks** - Container stays healthy

### Production Monitoring
- [ ] **Logs accessible** - `docker-compose logs -f`
- [ ] **Database persistent** - Data survives container restarts
- [ ] **Resource usage** - Monitor CPU/memory usage
- [ ] **Error handling** - Graceful error handling in production
